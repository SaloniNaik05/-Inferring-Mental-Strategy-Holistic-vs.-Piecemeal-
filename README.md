# Inferring Mental Strategy: Holistic vs. Piecemeal ðŸ§ 

This project investigates **how individuals process information**â€”whether they adopt a **holistic strategy** (seeing the big picture) or a **piecemeal strategy** (focusing on individual components). The analysis combines **data preprocessing, feature engineering, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), clustering, and visualization** to classify and understand mental strategies.

## ðŸ”¬ Objective
- Identify patterns in human decision-making strategies  
- Classify mental strategies as **Holistic** or **Piecemeal**  
- Provide visual insights for research and educational purposes  

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Collected raw datasets from eye-tracking, behavioral tests, and related experiments  
- Stored in `.csv` format for processing  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing and noisy values  
- Normalized data to improve model performance  
- Split dataset into **training** and **testing sets**  

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted meaningful features such as:  
  - Fixation duration  
  - Saccade distance  
  - Attention shifts  
- Selected features that are most predictive of holistic or piecemeal strategies  

### 4. Model Training

- **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** was trained on the processed features to classify participants as **Holistic** or **Piecemeal**.
- The HMM captures temporal patterns in the data, such as sequences of eye movements and attention shifts, making it ideal for this type of behavioral analysis.
- **Training Process:**
  - Dataset split into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.
  - Model parameters (number of states, transition probabilities) were optimized using the training set.
  - Evaluated performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **Model Saving:**
  - The trained model was saved as a `.pkl` file for reproducibility and future predictions:
  ```python
  import pickle
  with open('hmm_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
      pickle.dump(hmm_model, file)

### 5. Clustering
- Applied clustering algorithms to identify groups of similar strategies  
- Compared clusters with ground truth to validate classification  

### 6. Visualization ðŸ“Š
- Heatmaps for eye-tracking patterns  
- Scatter plots for feature clustering  
- Interactive plots to explore mental strategy behavior
